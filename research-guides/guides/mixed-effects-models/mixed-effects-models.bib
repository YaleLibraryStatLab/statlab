                  estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can
                  be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for
                  R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is
                  described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including
                  both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data
                  together determine a numerical representation of the model
                  from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML
                  criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model
                  parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one
                  of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the
                  parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model,
                  the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML
                  criterion, and the structure of classes or types that
                  represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to
                  allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to
                  write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such
                  as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that
                  are not easily expressible in the formula language used by
                  lmer.},

  abstract     = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze
                  nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data
                  such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical
                  procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a
                  more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when
                  random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs
                  in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for
                  practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the
                  availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM
                  parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to
                  fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing
                  remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in
                  ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and
                  summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for
                  scientists facing this challenge.},
